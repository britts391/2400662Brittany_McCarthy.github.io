                                In the future I hope to acheive a bachelor's degree in computer science with first class honours and
                                to have a  successful career as a computer programmer. I want to program large innovative projects that can help improve the world.
                                I  also, aim to be financially stable having a house, a car and helping my family .
                                Lastly, it is because of my parents hardwork faith and deducation in me and my education that I am able to persue my dreams and it will mean the most to me in the future to make them proud.

                                My mission is to stay hardworking and dedidcated and not to stray from my vision. I live by this quote whenever I am doing something it is
                                "Only the best is good enough". I use it as a reminder that in everything  put your best foot foward,
                                I want at the end  I can say I did my best and not have any regrets on what I should of done better.
                                Additionaly, I will also learn from  my mistakes and accept critiques and  advivse as they come.

                                <i> <u>Personality Traits:</u></i> <br><br>
                                &nbsp;<b>Hardworking</b> <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This personality trait has helped me achieve excellent grades
                                because I am always working and putting in the effort and time in my education. I do this by revising, pulling all-nighters,
                                staying focused, and always trying to find creative ways to understand lessons taught so that I can reap success.<br><br>

                                &nbsp<b>Leader</b> <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a natural-born leader. This personality
                                trait enhances my academic success by allowing me to be very organized, effective in teamwork,
                                have strong communication skills, and be accountable. This, in turn, enables me to achieve great grades as
                                I am able to work well with others, get things done in a timely manner, and assist where possible
                                so that my group members and I are all successful. <br><br>

                                &nbsp;<b>Time Management</b>  <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have good time management skills, and because of this
                                I am able to meet project deadlines. This has benefited me academically as I do not attract penalties
                                when submitting assignments, which would lower my grades. Additionally, having time management skills allows me to
                                organize and plan out my time effectively without rushing or stressing to complete tasks.<br><br>

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<center><u><i>Hobbies:</i></u></center><br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My hobbies are:<br><br>
                                &nbsp; <b>Reading</b><br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love to read and I often do it in my spare time. This helps me academically by
                                strengthening  my comprehension, expanding my vocabulary, and boosting my ability to analyze and
                                synthesize information. It also fosters my critical thinking, all of which contribute to strong performance in my education.<br><br>

                                &nbsp<b>Listening to music</b> <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to music is another hobby of mine. I often listen to music when completing assignments,
                                and it allows me to concentrate, and create a stress-free environment so that I can complete my assignments.<br><br>

                                &nbsp; <b>Watching movies</b><br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching movies has helped me academically by improving my cultural literacy and critical thinking.
                                Through various movies and documentaries, I have become exposed to the world and improved my comprehension and vocabulary.
                                This exposure enables me, when given a coding assignment, to imagine, relate, and create code that mimics real-life scenarios.

                                <i> <u>Mentor <span class="rotate-emoji"> &#129464;</span></u></i> <br><br>
                                My mentor is my father, Andrew McCarthy. My father is hardworking, determined, strong-willed, a hustler, and very family-oriented.
                                I look up to him because he never gave up, especially in situations where a person would crumble; he still remained optimistic.
                                My father is also wise and would often share his wisdom with me and the youths of my community.
                                He is  also very giving, and a people person, who always gives back in any form he can. <br><br>
                                <u>Background:</u><br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father is from the parish of St. Ann, from a small community called Exchange in Ocho Rios.
                                He did not grew up with much and therefore always strived for better. He also did not pass his subjects, so he was between menial jobs, but despite
                                this, my father was still hardworking and wanted better for himself. He eventually got a job at a security company called ATLAS,
                                where he worked hard and moved up, thereby uplifting himself. Eventually, my father made the decision to go back to school and pursue
                                a degree despite being in his early 40s and having children. In the end, he graduated from Caribbean Maritime University with
                                second class honors in security management. He then became the manager at his current workplace but he
                                did not stop there and went ahead and started a block factory. At first, he struggled and encountered a lot of bumps along the road
                                but never gave up. He was juggling a family, a demanding job, and a new upcoming business but his determination carried him through.
                                Today, my father's block factory has blossomed and expanded to a hardware store called Fernandez Hardware and Supplies.
                                He also went on to receive many awards for his hard work and dedication in his career.
                                His story has taught me to never give up and that hard work pays off.

                                <br><br><u>Favorite quote:</u><br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father is not one for quotes, but one thing he often says to me is,
                                "I give you everything so you can be better than me because I did not have the opportunities you have, and at the end,
                                I want you to be successful in life so that you are able to take care of yourself."
                                Another thing he always says is that all he wants in life is to live to see me be successful.
                                These words have always served as motivation for me in everything I do and therefore enable me to be hardworking and to never
                                stray from my goals.

                                                                                          AI to create a personal learning experience centered around the user. The AI tool would gather information on how the user learns whether they are visual, auditory,
                                                                                          or have a combination of both. The AI tool will  then create personalized diagrams, notes, videos, and more to help the user learn and succeed in their education.
                                                                                          This would be highly beneficial for me as I’m in university, studying five modules per semester in a short period of time.

                                                                                          This is because the tool is centered on an individual’s unique learning style, it would need to collect more than surface-level data and monitor user actions.
                                                                                          The company that creates this system would have access to how a person thinks, reasons, and grasps concepts, which could be misused for fraudulent manipulation if it fell

                                                                                          The system should collect only data necessary to deliver the personalized experience, with optional controls for what can be gathered.
                                                                                          It should also clearly outline all terms and conditions and provide transparent warnings about data usage.<br>

                                <i>Chapter 4 Achieve your goals Summary from 12 pillars</i><br><br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chapter first starts with Michael entering Mack's Diner looking for Charlie a maintenace person who he had recently met.
                                The chapter is centerd around their conversation held at the diner where Micheal expressed to Charlie is lack of goals and achievemnts stating he wants to achieve more.
                                To which Charlie starts to give him some advise stating he should start by writing his goals down."One of the best things you can do is
                                to write down one hundred things you want to accomplish before you die. Just the process of deciding what they are is powerful, but when you get them written down, watch out,
                                because now you are likely to achieve them." What Charlie meant by this is by thinking about writing your goals you have already started the process of achieveing them.
                                Just the thought of them alone can lead you to want to achieve them. This is very insightful to me because I believe in speak it into being and just like Charlie advising Micheal
                                to write down his goal I too also write down my goals and this helps me to manifest them and to constantly have them in the back part of mind where I mentaly cross them off one by one as I achieve them.
                                Another advise Charlie gave to Micheal quoting Mr Davis was"‘Make a million dollars, not for the million dollars, but for what you will have to become to make a million dollars."
                                I too resonated with this and found it to be good advise as not only should I write down and achieve my goals for the sake of just achieving them  but I should also achieve them for the person they will shape be to be.
                                I have already see this as the more I strive to higher my education is the more I find myself to be hard working, career driven and goal oriented.<br /><br />

                                <i> Chapter 5 The Proper Use of Time summary from the 12 pillars</i><br><br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chapter is a continuation of Michael and Charlie's  conversation in the diner. This time the conservation shifted to the value of time.
                                Charlie basically advised Michael based on the teachings of Mr Davis that time is very precious and it should be treated as such. Micheal should live his days achieving his goal and chasing his dreams because
                                "We must all suffer from one of two pains: The pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons." Which when charlie explained it means that when the
                                time comes and we are on our death bed let it be that you are not full of regret  because at that time you are weak and you can do nothing  but to look back at your life lived. You do not want to spend your last days with a ton of regret..
                                Charlie also went on to tell Micheal do not let time control you , you should control time, control your life or you will fall into a time trap just paying attention to the impertive things in life such as paying bills and not really achieving the important things and soon enough you will
                                fall into someone's time and they wiil have a plan for you. From this chapter I gather alot , Charlie as not only gave Micheal advise but also me. I too often find myself consumed by the impertive things in life such
                                as thinking about being finacially stable owning a house a car etc rather than thinking about living my life to the fullest. For example achieving career goals, finding good firends along the way or by just by exploring the world. Now that I read this I am sure to take Charlie's advice and try as much as possible to apply them in my life.
                                <br><br>
                                <i> Chapter 6 Surround Yourself With the Best People, summary from 12 pillars</i><br><br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this chapter, Michael went to Charlie's apartment, The Twelve Pillars, and they were having a conversation around the poolside while Charlie was cleaning the pool.
                                The topic of the conversation was about surrounding yourself with people who can elevate you. Charlie first asked Michael about his friends, after which Michael described his three closest friends.
                                One, John, got a job and dropped out of college but since then has been unable to leave because it pays the bills, though he is unhappy. Charlie described this as the "golden handcuffs" that the corporate world places on workers.
                                The other friend, Clark, has been unemployed for two years and just cannot seem to find anything that interests him. The third friend, whom Michael described as his best friend, is temperamental. After hearing this, Charlie said Michael should reconsider his friendships.
                                This was a hard pill for Michael to swallow, as he had been friends with them for years. Charlie went on to explain to Michael that your friends influence your attitude to some extent and also determine your direction. If you have friends who are pessimistic, resentful, angry, and unhappy, sooner or later they will influence you, and you will not grow.
                                If you find friends who are driven, goal oriented, and hardworking, so will you be too and you will grow. Additionally, your networks and position in life will grow too. Charlie further explained that Michael needs to be attractive to attract accomplished individuals as friends. So, Michael should focus on uplifting himself, and the right friends will come.
                                Throughout the chapter, we  also see Michael being conflicted with his friendships and his desire to grow in life. Charlie also advised that life is about tough decisions, and sometimes one has to let go of certain friends in order to achieve.


                                <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp; I personally know the feeling, as I too have cut off some friendships in order to better myself. In high school, I used to surround myself with large friend groups who would rather talk in class and idle away their time. I was the only one in the group who was focused on my education, and I often advised them to do the same, after which I would be criticized, called a nerd or boring.
                                I would also often achieve high grades and they would not, but I did not realize the impact of their friendship until my grades started to drop. I was once the quiet kid in class; now the teacher had to put me in front of her so I would focus and stop the talking.
                                It was then I realized that my friends were not bettering me, and if I continued, I would be on probation and my goals would be hindered. As a result, I distanced myself, started to focus on school, and surely enough, our friendship became non-existent.
                                Just like Michael, I too had to face a hard decision between friendship and my goals. Fast forward to today,I now have friends who are like-minded, who help each other study and achieve our goals.

                                <i> Chapter 7 Be a Life Long Learner, summary from 12 pillars</i><br><br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter continues the poolside conversation between Charlie and Michael, shifting focus to the importance of self-learning. Charlie emphasizes that in order to grow, self-education is essential. Quoting Mr. Davis, he explains that many people graduate from college believing they know everything, and as a result, they stop learning and become stagnant, failing to expand their horizons.
                                Charlie encourages Michael to keep learning , to seek wisdom from others, observe, read books, and reflect on past experiences. When Michael admits he’s not fond of reading, Charlie quickly challenges that mindset. He enlightens Michael on how something as simple as a book can significantly increase one’s success. Books, Charlie explains, can expand your understanding of the world and offer insight into the minds of the most successful individuals. Through reading, you engage in continuous self-learning, gaining knowledge beyond what is taught in school. You acquire new ideas, and when applied, they lead to personal achievement and success.

                                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own life, I’ve seen the benefits of reading and self-education firsthand. Reading is one of my favorite hobbies , every book introduces me to a new world. I truly believe that books allow you to travel to places without physically being there. Beyond that, reading has expanded my vocabulary and comprehension far beyond what is taught in the classroom.
                                I also believe that self-education is a key to success. By educating yourself, you become equipped with advanced knowledge in your chosen career path. This not only ensures a successful career but also provides long-term personal and professional growth.
